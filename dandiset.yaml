description: "The dataset includes spike times for recorded grid cells from the medial
  entorhinal cortex (MEC) in rats that explored two-dimensional environments. The
  behavioral data includes position from the tracking LEDs. \n\nThis sample was published
  in Sargolini et al. (Science, 2006).\n\nGrid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex
  (MEC) are part of an environment-independent spatial coordinate system. To determine
  how information about location, direction, and distance is integrated in the grid-cell
  network, we recorded from each principal cell layer of MEC in rats that explored
  two-dimensional environments. Whereas layer II was predominated by grid cells, grid
  cells colocalized with head-direction cells and conjunctive grid x head-direction
  cells in the deeper layers. All cell types were modulated by running speed. The
  conjunction of positional, directional, and translational information in a single
  MEC cell type may enable grid coordinates to be updated during self-motion-based
  navigation.\n"
